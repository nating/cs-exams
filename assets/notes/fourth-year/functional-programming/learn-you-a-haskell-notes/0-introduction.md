## Introduction

**Lazy Evaluation**, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed. This is the opposite of **Strict** evaluation.

**Statically Typed** programming languages do type checking (the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types) at compile-time as opposed to run-time.

`:r` reloads the current script in GHCI.
