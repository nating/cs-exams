# CS4051 Human Factors Notes

These notes will be kept brief and to the point with a focus on what might be necessary for succeeding in exam questions. (I'm no authority on what is, but that's all I'm looking for!)

If the language in some of the notes does not make sense, it means I didn't re-write the language of that bit!
