## Design Process

According to Gavin: Design is *"Achieving goals within constraints"*.

**Interaction Design** has four basic activities:  
* Identify needs and establish requirements for the UX.
* Develop versions of designs to meet the requirements.
* Build interactive versions of the designs so they can be communicated & assesed.
* *"Evaluate what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers."*

**Characteristics of the user population** include:  
* Types of user
* Frequency of use
* Discretion about use
* Experience of the task
* Level of training
* Experience of computer systems

**Requirements Gathering** involves:  
* Determining characteristics of the user population.
* Determining characteristics of the tasks.
* Determining constraints and objectives.

The ISO Usability Standard 9241 adopts three traditional usability categories: effectiveness, efficiency & satisfaction.

**Scenarios** are step-by-step descriptions of a user's actions that can be used as a tool in requirements gathering, interface design and evaluation.

When Gavin refers to **Ethnography** he is talking about participating in users interacting with the systems (asking questions etc.).
