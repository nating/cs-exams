# Notes on the 4C16 Module - Machine Learning

The 4C16 Module is an introduction to Machine Learning especially on Deep Neural Nets.

## Introduction to the Module

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine Learning is part of the field of artificial intelligence.

Deep Learning or *Artificial Neural Networks* is particular type of Machine Learning.

<TODO What is Deep Learning? >

Machine Learning is split up into three main fields:

* **Supervised Learning** involves inferring a function from labelled training data.
* **Unsupervised Learning** involves drawing inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses, such as finding hidden patterns or groupings of data.
* **Reinforcement Learning** involves agents interacting with their environment in such a way to get the maximum reward.

Neural Networks are the only machine learning technique whose performance scales efficiently with the training data size.

## Module Content

In the 2017/18 academic year, there are no previous exam papers so there the tutorials are examples of the type of exam questions that students can expect.

The 4C16 module is split up into two parts:  
**Machine Learning Fundamentals** & **Neural Network Fundamentals**.
